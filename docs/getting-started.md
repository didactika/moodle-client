# Getting started

## Install

```console
npm install @didactika/moodle-client
```

Node 20 or newer. The package has no runtime dependencies — it is built on
`fetch` and `URLSearchParams` from the standard library — and ships
CommonJS, ESM and type declarations, so `require` and `import` both work
with no configuration.

## Preparing the Moodle side

A web service call needs three things from the site, and none of them are
things this package can create for you.

**1. Web services enabled.** *Site administration -> General -> Advanced
features -> Enable web services*.

**2. The REST protocol enabled.** *Site administration -> Server -> Web
services -> Manage protocols*, and switch on *REST protocol*. This client
speaks REST with `moodlewsrestformat=json`; it does nothing with XML-RPC or
SOAP.

**3. A token, on a service that exposes the functions you plan to call.**
*Site administration -> Server -> Web services -> External services* to
define the service and add functions to it, then *Manage tokens* to issue a
token for a user on that service.

The token inherits the permissions of the user it was issued for. A call
that works for you as an administrator and fails for a service account is
almost always a capability problem on the Moodle side, not a problem here —
it will come back as an `AccessException`.

## The first call

```ts
import { MoodleClient } from "@didactika/moodle-client";

const moodle = new MoodleClient({
  rootURL: "https://moodle.example.org",
  token: process.env.MOODLE_TOKEN!,
});

// 1. Direct typed method (Recommended):
// Gives you full IDE autocomplete and typed responses out of the box
const { data } = await moodle.webservice.core_webservice_get_site_info();

// 2. Or dynamic call by name:
// const { data } = await moodle.call("core_webservice_get_site_info");

console.log(data.sitename, data.username);
```

`core_webservice_get_site_info` is the one worth starting with: it needs no
parameters and it tells you which user the token belongs to, so a successful
call confirms the site URL, the protocol and the token in one go.

`rootURL` is the site root — the URL you would type in a browser — not the
path to `server.php`. Trailing slashes are fine either way.

## Passing parameters

Moodle's REST endpoint has no notion of nested JSON: everything arrives as
flat `parent[child][index]` keys. Write the object the natural way and let
the client flatten it automatically.

```ts
// Direct method with full parameter autocompletion:
const { data } = await moodle.webservice.core_course_get_courses({
  options: {
    ids: [1, 2, 3],
  },
});

// Or using .call():
// const { data } = await moodle.call("core_course_get_courses", {
//   options: { ids: [1, 2, 3] },
// });
```

goes out as:

```
options[ids][0]=1&options[ids][1]=2&options[ids][2]=3
```

`null` and `undefined` are dropped, since Moodle has no representation for
either. Everything else is stringified.

## Three ways to call

### 1. Direct typed methods (Recommended)

`MoodleClient` provides direct methods through namespaces. Out of the box, the
bundled `webservice` namespace contains 700+ typed Moodle 4.5 web service functions:

```ts
const moodle = new MoodleClient({ rootURL, token });

// Autocomplete on function names, parameters and response types:
const courses = await moodle.webservice.core_course_get_courses({
  options: { ids: [1, 2] },
});

const users = await moodle.webservice.core_user_get_users({
  criteria: [{ key: "email", value: "a@b.c" }],
});
```

You can also generate custom namespaces for other Moodle versions (e.g. 4.4)
or local plugin directories via `npx moodle-generate-schemas`.

### 2. Dynamic `.call()` method

`MoodleClient` also settles the site, token, and default HTTP method once while
allowing you to call any function dynamically by string name. Use this for
dynamic function calls or third-party plugins where pre-generated schemas
are not available:

```ts
const moodle = new MoodleClient({ rootURL, token });

// Dynamic call with untyped response (any) or generic type argument:
const courses = await moodle.call("core_course_get_courses");
const users = await moodle.call("core_user_get_users", {
  criteria: [{ key: "email", value: "a@b.c" }],
});
```

### 3. One-shot `moodleClient()` helper

`moodleClient()` is the one-shot form the package originally shipped with. It is
not going away, and it goes through exactly the same network and error-handling path:

```ts
import { moodleClient } from "@didactika/moodle-client";

const response = await moodleClient({
  urlRequest: { rootURL, token, webServiceFunction: "core_course_get_courses" },
  content: { options: { ids: [1, 2, 3] } },
});
```
